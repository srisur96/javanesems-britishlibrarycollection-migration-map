Medicines for children are also\nmentioned. The idiom is pre-Islamic Javanese; the style is succinct and\npragmatic, using many abbreviations for days, weeks, and wukus . The top and bottom lines of the leaves are\ndarkened and often illegible. The leaves have no original numbering (or it is\nillegible) and seem to be out of order. Dr. Pigeaud suggests the MS may be 17th\ncentury or a little earlier, and perhaps from the countryside of Central or\nEast Java. In Javanese language, in Buda or gunung script, regular and done with care.",
